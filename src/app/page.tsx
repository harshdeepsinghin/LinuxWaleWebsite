                  Linux may refer to two things: the Linux operating system, which is a free and open-source Unix-like system, and the Linux kernel, which is the core component responsible for managing hardware resources and providing essential services. The kernel serves as the foundation upon which various operating systems are built, enabling them to function efficiently and interact with the underlying hardware.

                  Linux offers unparalleled freedom, security, and customization.
                  It&apos;s free from corporate control, highly secure by design, and
                  gives you complete control over your computing experience. With
                  thousands of distributions to choose from, Linux adapts to your
                  needs rather than forcing you to adapt to it. Plus, it&apos;s the
                  backbone of the internet, powering servers, supercomputers, and
                  embedded systems worldwide.
